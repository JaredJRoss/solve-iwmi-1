# DSSG Solve: International Water Management Institute

## Project Team: Ancil Crayton, Jared Ross, João Fonseca, Marcelo Sandoval-Castañeda

### Background 

Droughts and floods, which account for 94% of all extreme weather-related fatalities, are predicted to become more frequent in the coming years. By 2050, more than 1 billion people worldwide will be affected by extreme drought. Similarly, major flooding events will become 6 times more frequent worldwide under climate change. These extreme weather events can have devastating impacts on communities around the globe, but the diversity of people's experiences of them are difficult to capture and communicate. 

### Objective 

The DSSG Solve team aims to collaborate with the International Water Management Institute to create an interactive web app that leverages online data such as social media posts, news headlines and research publications to paint a fuller picture of the impacts of extreme weather events, like droughts and floods. This research tool would help users better understand how people personally experience extreme weather events, enable them to compare descriptions of the extreme weather events from individuals' perspectives with local, regional and international news coverage and analyze how the effects of extreme weather events are spatially and temporally distributed, thus providing a lens into discourse on water-related issues.
